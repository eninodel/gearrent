## Overview
### Description
AirBnb for outdoor gear. Users can rent outdoor gear such as kayaks, climbing gear, bicycles, etc. from other users.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Current focus is on mobile.
- **Story:** Allows users to see rentable gear in their area and allows them to make reservations. Additionally users can add their own gear to be available for rent.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to do outdoor activities but doen't have hte fund or means to acquire the gear to do so. Also for people who have unused gear looking to earn some extra cash.
- **Habit:** This app can be used everytime a user wants to do an outdoor activity but doesn't want to buy the gear outright.
- **Scope:** Start with allowing users to rent outdoor gear and then expand into other categories.
